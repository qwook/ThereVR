                     <p> <strong> INTRODUCTION </strong> </p>
                     <p>ThereVR  (the “Company,” “us,” or “we”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company’s ThereVR Platform and other related services (collectively, “the Services”). We created this Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Services, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Policy is only applicable to the Services, and not to any other external websites that you may be able to access from the Services that are not maintained by the Company, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.</p>
                     <p>We take the security and privacy of your personal information very seriously and only collect personally identifiable information that is appropriate for you to use, interact, and improve the Services.</p>
                     <p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</strong></p>       
                     <p><strong>What Basic Information Does the Company Collect?</strong></p>
                     <p> When a Driver or Rider signs up to use ThereVR (“User”), we may collect the Users’s name, email address, date of birth, gender, university name, location, and password created on the ThereVR Platform. In order for Users to complete their account creation, we may also collect each User’s photo to use and apply as their profile picture. </p>
                     <p><strong>What Additional Information May the Company Collect?</strong></p>
                     <p>We may automatically collect the following information about your use of our Services: access time; device ID, application ID, or other unique identifier; domain name; IP address; language information; device name and model; operating system information; your activities within the Services; and the length of time that you are logged in.  </p>
                     <p><strong>USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>What Does the Company Do With Collected Information?</strong></p>
                     <p>(a) PERSONAL INFORMATION. We will share all of a User’s information, except passwords, with other Users that use the ThereVR Service. This includes but is not limited to name, gender, and location. </p>
                     <p>The Company will not share your personal information with any other third parties, including Users or Customers that are not associated with ThereVR, without your consent, except as necessary to provide you with the Services offered by us or to comply with the law. We may use your personal information to verify your identity, to check your eligibility to engage in ThereVR Services, or to follow up with inquired or concerns about the Services. We may also use your contact information to inform you of any changes to the Services, or to send you additional information about the Company. If you give your permission, we may share your contact information with our business partners or other companies that we integrate with.</p>
                     <p>(b) ANONYMOUS INFORMATION. We use anonymous information to analyze traffic on the Services and improve, operate, and debug the Services, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. In addition, we may use anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Services, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and engagement information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.</p>  
                     <p>(c) DISCLOSURE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in accordance with our the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on the Company or its parent company, subsidiaries, or affiliates, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company or the Users of ThereVR, or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or Users of ThereVR.</p>
                     <p> (d) SALE OF INFORMATION. In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy portions of the Company or other companies or assets, including the information collected through the Services. If the Company or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the assets transferred to the acquirer.</p>
                     <p>(e) ACCESS TO INFORMATION. You may review, update, correct, and/or delete personal information through the account management features available on the ThereVR Platform after you log into your account. You may also contact Enter Contact Information to request that your user profile or other personal information be deleted from the Services and/or removed from ThereVR mailing lists. Each email sent to you also includes instructions for unsubscribing to ThereVR emails at the bottom of the email, and these requests will be processed as quickly as practicable. The Company reserves the right to verify your identity in such cases. </p>
                     <p>Even after account modification or removal, copies of personal information may remain on the Services to the extent that it had been previously shared with other Users or Customers. In addition, the Company may retain certain information in order to prevent identity theft and other illegal activities after an approved deletion. Removed information may remain in archives, but will not be available to other users or third parties.</p> 
                     <p><strong>SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS </strong></p>
                     <p>We have security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss or misuse to you or to any third party, or to prevent any damages arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>
                     <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>
                     <p><strong>AREAS BEYOND COMPANY’S CONTROL</strong></p>
                     <p>The Services may contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit other websites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those other websites, and it is your responsibility to review the privacy policies at those websites to confirm that you understand and agree with their policies.</p>
                     <p><strong>NOTICE CONCERNING THE INFORMATION OF CHILDREN</strong></p>

                     <p><strong>UPDATES AND CHANGES</strong></p>
                     <p>We reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update, or modify this Policy, simply by posting such change, update, or modification on the Services and without any other notice to you. Any such change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Services. It is your responsibility to review this Policy from time to time to ensure that you continue to agree with all of its terms.</p>
